# AppleScript Greetings Program

First introduced in System 7, it is currently included in all versions of macOS as part of a package of system automation tools. The term "AppleScript" may refer to the language itself, to an individual script written in the language, or, informally, to the macOS Open Scripting Architecture that underlies the language.

2. Click the `Run` button in the Script Editor window.
3. Enter your name in the prompt and click `OK`.
